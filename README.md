# Problems
- `gossipcop_train` is too large — there's a way to fix it later (e.g., filtering by source credibility or truncating long articles).
- Changed the script a lot to make it simpler for other readers — may introduce edge-case bugs.
- No `requirements.txt` file yet — need to pin versions for reproducibility.
